![Emojify App](https://cyberfantics-emojify-app-siktsr.streamlit.app/)  

## 📌 Project Overview  
**Emojify** is a deep learning-based application that detects human facial expressions and maps them to corresponding emojis or avatars. This project utilizes **computer vision** and **deep learning** techniques to enhance user interactions through emotion-based emoji generation.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Real-time facial expression detection  
✅ Emoji mapping based on classified emotions  
✅ Interactive web app using **Streamlit**  
✅ Built with **OpenCV, Keras, NumPy, and PIL**  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Deep Learning** (Keras, TensorFlow)  
- **Computer Vision** (OpenCV)  
- **Web App Framework** (Streamlit)  
- **Python Libraries** (NumPy, PIL)  

## 📂 Installation  
Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyberfantics/Emojify.git
cd Emojify
```

### Install dependencies:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
